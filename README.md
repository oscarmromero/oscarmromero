### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a engineer who is passionate about learning, creating, and repairing. I am facisnate about open-source software and my passion is melding of software and hardware. My professional career was in the bio-pharma industry. After taking a hard look at myself, where I want be and want make me excited, I decided to take sometime off to build the necessary skills to become an indispensable software engineer. 

I am currently working through [Launch School](https://www.google.com "Launch School Homepage"). Currently getting my feet with Ruby!
